This project focuses on facial emotion recognition for elderly individuals, especially those with dementia, where verbal emotional expression is limited.

Instead of using deep learning, this system adopts a rule-based and geometry-based approach using facial landmarks.
The goal is to provide an interpretable and lightweight solution suitable for small datasets and caregiving scenarios.
